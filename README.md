# Robot_direction_control
The aim of the project is to design a simple and user-friendly webpage that allows users to control the movement of a robot base through buttons (to control directions: Forward, Backward, Left, Right, and Stop). The system stores robot movement data in an SQL database and retrieves the latest movement data when needed.
