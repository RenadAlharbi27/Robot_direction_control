# **Robot Movement Control Web Application**

## **Project Overview**
This project is a web-based application designed to control the movement of a robot base through a simple and user-friendly interface. The application allows users to send movement commands (e.g., Forward, Backward, Left, Right, and Stop) to a robot, and these commands are stored in an SQL database for tracking purposes. Additionally, the system provides functionality to retrieve the last movement command from the database.
